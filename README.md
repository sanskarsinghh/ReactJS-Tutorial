👋 Welcome to our repository, created with the sole purpose of providing developers with a comprehensive testing environment for a pre-built React component.

🚀 The component is designed to be easily integrated into any React project, allowing developers to experiment with different functionalities and test their code in a safe and controlled environment.

👨‍💻 With this repository, developers can access a sandbox environment where they can confidently test their code, without worrying about the consequences of failure. This provides the perfect opportunity for experimentation and exploration.

🤝 We encourage developers to contribute their own code and feedback, helping us improve the component and the overall testing environment. With an open-source mindset, our aim is to create a collaborative community of developers, sharing their ideas and experiences to drive innovation.

❗️Please note that this repository is not intended for production use, and should only be used for testing and development purposes.
